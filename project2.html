            <p> This project first began around the middle of April. It was, at the beginning, for one of my class, but I was so interested in the project that I went above and beyond and implemented things that weren't asked in the first place. This project help me understand the final few things I didn't understand completly at first. Now that I've done this project, I'm feeling a lot more confient with C++ and can confidently say that I would accept any challenge that comes my way. This project also allowed me to work differently than normal, having to use a header file programmed by someone else, which gave me experience in an industry setting which I think is something really important to have experience in before getting a job in the domain.</p>

        <div class="second-content">
          <p> Like I stated above, this project forced me to work in way I had never experienced before, it made me work with file I didn't develop myself which was something difficult to adapt to. Although it was quite difficult to work with, I managed to handle it and learned from this experience by getting some professional work experience. This project also allowed me to perfect my C++ skills and I went above and beyond by implementing some things that weren't asked for like a menu to decide how many transactions you would want the program to output or also by resting the screen at every oprations while keeping a header.</p>
          <p> Except for the slight issues I had trying to make the other person's work work with my code, I didn't have much issues while deelopping this project, I knew almost all of the things that were required to accomplish this task and the things I didn't know how to do, I simply learned them and now, I will certainly know them for the rest of my programming career. Like my other projects, the uploading to Github part was not an issue I knocked that task off the list of things to do fairly quickly.</p>
