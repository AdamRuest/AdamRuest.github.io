            <p> I first started this project back in the middle of January 2022. It was for one of my class and the end goal was to have a website that I could send to employers so that it can be some sort of resume. The prototype was soon ready and I could then begin the building of the website in itself. This was no easy task tho, being my first HTML/CSS project, I had no idea of what I was getting myself into. But, I soon figured how to navigate my way through the Visual Code editor and understood every concept pretty quickly. The First iteration of the website was ready about 3 month after the start of the project, it was only the layout tho and it had little to no content in it. I then began to fill it up with my personnal details and was soon done with the final project that I then uploaded to Github after having fixed some minor issues and cleaning the code a bit.</p>

          <p> This project being my first HTML/CSS, it thought me a lot about the web design industry. I liked this project so much that I wanted to do web design as a self-employed employee, but due to financial reasons, I couldn't achieve that goal. Anyways, this project introduced me to the web design industry and I would like to maybe be part of it some day. Ever since I started learnign the HTML and CSS programming language, I've enjoyed working wiht them and do not intend to back down from any challenge that may come my way in the neer future.</p>
          <p> In term of difficulty, in this project, I did encounter some problematic situation. But I did not give up and solved all the issues with, for the most part, not so much trouble. The only thing that was really difficult to me was to first understand the CSS coding language, but once I got used to it, it was smooth sailing for there on out. Exporting my project to Github wasn't a problem either, I figured it out pretty quick and my website was up and running quickly after it was done.</p>
