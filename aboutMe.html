          <p> I have been working physically and internally with computers for over 5 years now and am ready for a real job in the domain. I've learned a lot, both from my studies and from my personal learnings and think I got most of it under control. I have learned about programmation in high school on the school calculators, and got in trouble by coding the game "Space Invaders" entirely in the calculator. After that small experience, I got interested in real game design and began lerning C# to get myself used with the Unity game development engine. I then decided to dive further in programmation by beginning studies in a programming oriented school in Rimouski, close to my home town, in which I learned to use HTML, CSS, TypeScript and C++ so far. </p>
        </div>
        <p> While I learned a lot in the programmation aspect of the job, I've also been learning by myself on the computer building part. I've began building computers back in my third year of high school. My first computer was a basic build on which I could only spend upwards of one thousand canadian dollar on. I then began upgrading that same computer for many years and it wasn't until I finished high school that I built my second computer. This time tho, I had more money so I spent more on an AIO cooling system, multiple SSDs and overall better parts. I've had this computer for over a year now and have been upgrading it at a constant pace ever since I got it. Although I'm better and and overall like more the programming aspect of things, I also like a lot the computer building part and find it relaxing to do, giving me an activity to do that I enjoy and can find satisfaction in. I'd be more than happy to have a job in the programming aspect of things, although I wouldn't mind finding a job in the computer building part and would take the job in a heartbeat.</p>

        <h1> Past Experiences and Projects </h1>
        <p> In the past, I've worked at many different jobs non-related to computers which I won't be mentionning in this part. But, at times, I worked at upwards of four jobs at a time, sometimes even being unable to spend some time with people who I care about. This life style was, for me at least, not too tireing and was quite frankly fun for me, I met a lot of nice people, some not so nice. This as though me a lot about work in general, I like to work hard to achieve something amazing, whatever the cost. It also though me not to make excuses for anything, peoples are counting on me to make the business run, and me disappointing them is the last thing I would want to happen.</p>
        <div class="col-left">
          <p> While my work experiences are quite unusual and that those days are gone, I've got some projects that I developped, some during my work years, some during school. I've always thrived for those projects to be as close as possible to the requested product. I've never cut corners while doing programmation projects and I'm always proud of what comes out on the table as an end result. Those same project, like my work experience, have though me a lot when it comes to a job in the computer engineering aspect. I've learned to respect the demand that you get to the absokute detail, otherwise the customer will be upset, I've also learned to go above and beyond to fix a problem, I won't be doing anything sketchy to fix a problem and will always find the right solution. Anyways, you can take a look at my projects through this button.</p>
